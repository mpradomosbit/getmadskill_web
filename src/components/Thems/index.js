                  Failure by either party to exercise any of its rights under, or to enforce any provision of, this
                  Agreement will not be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights or ability to enforce such
                  provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                  illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be amended to achieve as nearly as possible the
                  same economic effect of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full
                  force and effect.

                <p className="paragraph">
                  15.1 These provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or access, download and use or Services
                  in the United States. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or download
                  or use or Services from outside the United States. See below for more detail.

                  15.2 Initial Dispute Resolution. If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Service, our
                  customer support team should be your first point of contact. Most concerns are quickly resolved in
                  this manner to our customers' satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any
                  dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations
                  which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

                  15.3 Binding Arbitration. If the parties do not reach a mutually agreed solution within a period of 30
                  days from the time initial dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph above, then either
                  party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the
                  terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms and the
                  Privacy Policy (including its interpretation, formation, performance, and breach), the parties'
                  relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding
                  arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration
                  Rules or Streamlined Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or
                  permitting class actions. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving
                  interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation,
                  applicability, enforceability and formation of these terms notwithstanding any other choice of law
                  provision contained in these terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or
                  agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the
                  interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these terms, including without
                  limitation any claim that all or any part of these terms or the Privacy Policy is void or voidable, or
                  whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief
                  would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the
                  parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The JAMS rules
                  governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800)
                  352-5267. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the
                  JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards,
                  including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the
                  arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. The parties
                  understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a
                  jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the
                  costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

                <p className="paragraph">
                  15.4 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable
                  location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States,
                  arbitration shall be initiated in Denver County, Colorado, and you and we agree to submit to the
                  personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Denver County, Colorado, in order to compel
                  arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment
                  on the award entered by the arbitrator.

                <p className="paragraph">
                  15.5 The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities
                  only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their
                  right to file a class action to seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
                  CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR THE PRIVACY
                  POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                  PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class
                  action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an
                  arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be
                  deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
                  disputes.

                  15.6 Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party
                  may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or
                  invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade
                  secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the
                  Services under these terms. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or
                  claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.

                  15.7 You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver
                  provisions set forth in the paragraphs above by sending us written notice of your decision to opt-out.
                  The notice must be sent within 30 days of your commencement of use of the Service, otherwise you shall
                  be bound to arbitrate disputes as provided for herein. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions,
