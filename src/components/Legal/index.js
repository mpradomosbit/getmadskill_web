                  USE OF COOKIES, AD IDENTIFIERS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

                <p className="paragraph">
                  Advertisers on mobile devices sometimes use advertising identifiers to enable and optimize their
                  advertising. Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal device identifiers such as the Android
                  advertising ID and Apple's ID for advertising ("IDFA"). We and third-parties who advertise on our
                  Service may use cookies or similar technologies such as tracking pixels in advertising. These
                  technologies operate either by placing a small file which stores some information on your computer or
                  mobile device and/or by accessing information on your device. These technologies allow the collection
                  of data, such as your device's model, operating system and screen size, the other applications
                  installed on your device, and information about how you use our services.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                  Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer or mobile device. They are unique to your
                  account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are
                  automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser
                  delete them or until they expire. We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites,
                  and these cookies are both our own and third-party cookies, such as Google Analytics.

                <p className="paragraph">
                  You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for internet-based advertising, or
                  you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary
                  based-upon device, but usually you will find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in
                  your device's settings. You can disable cookies through your web or mobile browser settings.

                  Although we and our advertising partners use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies to

                  described above does not mean that you will not receive advertisements, it only means the

                  We take security seriously and are committed to protecting our users' information. We take various
                  steps to protect the information you provide to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or
                  disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and
                  store, and the current state of technology. Your password protects your user account, so you should
                  use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having
                  used the Service. While we take data protection precautions, no security measures are infallible, and
                  we do not guarantee the security of user information.
